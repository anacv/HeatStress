# HeatStress
Heat Stress indices for Heat-Shield

## What is `HeatStress`?

**HeatStress** is a R package for the calculation of heat stress indices. It has been developed in the framework of the Horizon2020 [HEAT-SHIELD project](www.heat-shield.eu).

****

### Installation

The recommended procedure for installing the package is using the devtools package. 

```R
devtools::install_github("anacv/HeatStress")
```

A list of all available indices and the atomic functions calculating them is printed on screen with:

```R
library(HeatStress)
indexShow()
```

### Reference and further information: 

This package was used in the development of climate change scenarios of heat stress, in the following publications:
