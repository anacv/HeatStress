Changes in version 1.0.1
  * Added option for enforcing tas >= dewpoint
  * Rearranged code in `wbgt.Bernard` and `wbgt.Liljegren` to improve performance
  * Changed default tolerance to 1e-4 in `wbgt.Bernard` and `wbgt.Liljegren`

Changes in version 1.0.2
  * Added a third option to treat situations with dewpoint > tas, in `wbgt.Bernard` and `wbgt.Liljegren`.
  * Corrected bug in zenith angle calculation with hourly data (compatibility to POSIXlt).

Changes in version 1.0.3
  * Corrected bug when customizing tolerance in `wbgt.Liljegren`.
  * Change the interval to estimate Tg in `wbgt.Liljegren`.
  
Changes in version 1.0.4
  * Inclusion of more heat indices.
  
Changes in version 1.0.5
  * Arrange assert statments in wrapper function to speed up calculation of wbgt.Liljegren.

Changes in version 1.0.7
  * Update README.md
  
Changes in version 1.0.8
  * Update hi.R with all adjustments in https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/html/heatindex_equation.shtml. Update also documentation.
  * Check that relative humidity is not larger than 100 (in all indices depending on this variable).
  * Add script to calculate dew point temperature from air temperature and relative humidity.
  
Changes in version 1.0.8.1
